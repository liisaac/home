		Cloud9 has had an extremely long history of ups and downs. Cloud9 has not had tons of success in the "Counter-Strike Global Offensive" but have just recently won the ELEAGUE 2018: Boston major. The roster has changed many times previous to this major (and have failed), but the current roster is probably the best yet. It consists of Stewie2k, Autimatic, Tarik, Rush, and Skadoodle (Skadaddy). The reason that Cloud9 was so successful in this major is because they played with very good teamwork as well as individually. The players were successful in clutch attempts, as well as playing retake on CT-side, and executing to perfection on T-side

		<h5>*Different Roster</h5>
		<p>As you can see from the table above, This team has definitely had some success before the Major that they won this year. However, the previous championships were not "majors". The ELEAGUE major this year is the first major that has been won by any North American team in "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" history. This was truly a hard result for them, as they eliminated all of the top 4 teams in the world: Astralis, G2 Esports, SK Gaming, and FaZe Clan. The championship match itself was absolutely amazing. In a best-of-three series, Cloud9 tied the series 1-1, and in the final game, they came back down seven rounds to make it into overtime. They then won it in double overtime to grasp the trophy. After the tournament, they improved from 5th ranked in the world to 3rd ranked.</p>
